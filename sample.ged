2 TITL Origin Displayed: English - Origins Available: English, German. Spelling variations of this family name include: Deblot, Bolt, Bold, Boald, Boalt, Boltt, Bolde, Bolte, Boult and many more. First found in Lancashire where they held a family seat fro
3 CONC m ancient times. Some of the first settlers of this family name or some of its variants were: Margaret Bold who settled in Virginia in 1635; Andrew and Valentine Bold settled in Philadelphia Pa. in 1865 and 1873 respectively; Gabriell Bolt settle
3 CONC d in the Barbados in 1635. (From www.HouseOfNames.com Archives copyright © 2000 - 2009). Recorded as Boltwood and Boultwood, this is an English surname. It is locational and derives either from the village known as Boltonwood in Cumbria, or fro
3 CONC m a now 'lost' medieval village which was probably called 'Bopl - wudu' or similar. This translates as 'the house in the wood', or possibly 'the wood on the ridge'. At least five thousand British surnames are known to originate from 'lost' villages
3 CONC , and this name seems to be a good example of the genre. There are several explanations for 'lost' villages, including plague, civil war, and changes in farming practice, of which the latter is the most likely. From the 16th century and the beginni
3 CONC ng of the Industrial Revolution, the demand for wool was such that all available land was turned over to sheep farming. This system required far fewer workers than arable farming, leading to a wholesale clearance of villages. Locational surnames we
3 CONC re given to people after they moved to new locations, it being an easy identification to call people by the name of their former village. Early examples of the surname recording may include Ann Bolworth of Market Harborough, Leicestershire, on 25 J
3 CONC anuary 1665, and certainly does include Ann Boltwood, who married William Rogers at the church of St Mary-le-Bone, London, on 2 October 1790. An example of an unusual christian name is that of Zipporah Boultwood, who married William Kirk, at Hoxto
3 CONC n on 23 February 1823. Throughout the centuries, surnames in every country have continued to "develop" often leading to astonishing variants of the original spelling. © Copyright: Name Origin Research www.surnamedb.com 1980 - 2014.

1 CONT (Shorter version:) John Eagar was born July 13, 1823, in New York state. He went to school until he was 13. His father's health had failed, and John, being the oldest son, began working. John and some of his family joined the Church of Jesus Chris
1 CONC t of Latter-day Saints. They sailed around Cape Horn on the ship Brooklyn, arriving in San Francisco. John traveled the rest of the way to Salt Lake by land travel with some Mormon Battalion members.
1 CONT The summer after he arrived in Utah, 26-year-old John Eagar married 17-year-old Sariah Johnson, in Salt Lake City. A few years later, they were sealed. They would have fifteen years together, and eight children. They settled in Manti, Utah. He serv
1 CONC ed as City Clerk for twelve years, though his main occupation was as a printer. He assisted printing the following newspapers: The Prophet (in NYC,) the California Star, and the Deseret News.
1 CONT He only lived to be forty years old. He is buried in Manti Cemetery, just down the hill from the Temple.
1 CONT --------(Longer sketch) -------------
1 CONT John Eagar was born July 13, 1823, in Auburn, New York to Thomas Eagar and Lucy (Buell) Eagar.  
1 CONT  He was the oldest of eight. He had four sisters and three sisters.
1 CONT His father was a widower.  His first wife he married in about 1820 and she and a son died during childbirth.  He son began working as a brick and stone mason building a prison in Auburn which was started in 1816 and rebuilt in 1828.  Here he met Lu
1 CONC cy Buell.  They married and started their family as explained earlier.  In 1825 his parents moved to Sing Sing New York to build a prison there.  Sing Sing is on the East bank of the Hudson River about 34 miles north New York City. He wrote that h
1 CONC e went to school until he was thirteen, he had to quit school to help earn money for his family because of his father’s poor health. His father was “keeping” a hotel and working on the prison at the time.  It is said much of his father’s ma
1 CONC sonry work is still found in the prison walls there today.  At about this same time John broke his leg which he wrote more or less affected his life since though many never noticed his “lameness.”
1 CONT His father eventually passed away after a long illness on June 9, 1841 from what they called consumption. Consumption is now called tuberculosis. After his passing, the family had to move about from place to place and soon the little they had seeme
1 CONC d to vanish as Lucy tried to survive with seven children to raise.
1 CONT They were living in the Mt. Pleasant area at that time as John’s three youngest siblings were recorded as being born there.  This is still in the Sing Sing area.  John’s mother had joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and mos
1 CONC t or all of the children who could.  It is unclear if Thomas did.
1 CONT At some point John began to work for Samuel Brannan who had been working on different publications for the Church.  John worked as a “printer’s devil” for Brannan on “The Prophet” which was a local newspaper printed in New York City.  Thi
1 CONC s paper’s first editor was William Smith (Joseph Smith’s brother) and was only printed about a year.  It probably was started to help Joseph Smith’s presidential campaign.   Later this paper became the New-York Messenger, it too lasted onl
1 CONC y a short time.   A printer’s devil was just under the apprentice and did whatever was asked or needed.  He advanced in the trade and became an apprentice and learned the business very well.   After the martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum Brannan got s
1 CONC eparated for a time from the Church because he pushed for William to succeed Joseph.  He eventually repaired his standing and when the Saints left Nauvoo by wagon, he obtained permission to take a group of Saints by boat around Cape Horn to go West
1 CONC .  
1 CONT He left with 238 other Latter Day Saints aboard the ship Brooklyn on a 24,000 mile journey around Cape Horn of South America to the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii) and then to California.  They left on February 4, 1846, just by coincidence the same day s
1 CONC aints first crossed the Mississippi River for the West.  John Eagar age 23, his mother and two sisters and two brothers (Mary, Thomas, Arabella, and William) all were aboard.  Much can be read about this voyage elsewhere.  John’s mother Lucy an
1 CONC d 3 others were excommunicated by Samuel Brannan while on the voyage for “promoting” what he considered “false and dangerous doctorines”, something that hurt her and she drifted away from the Church the rest of her life. Many on the ship fe
1 CONC lt this was wrong and was a brash abuse of his authority.
1 CONT Their journey was challenging, they truly were pioneers themselves just of the oceans.  They arrived in Yerba Buena (now San Francisco) on July 31, 1846. It was a town of about 150 people and was a part of California that had been taken by the US f
1 CONC orces by defeating Mexico on 3 weeks earlier.  A US warship had sailed into Yerba Buena and planted a US flag there.  
1 CONT The Saints swelled the number of people in San Francisco and remained there until they could find out where the land pioneers were.  They believed they were coming all the way to California too.  By 1847 San Francisco was largely a Mormon town.  I
1 CONC t wouldn’t be until July of 1847 before Brigham Young and the first wagon train stopped in Salt Lake City.  Earlier in the spring Samuel Brannan and two others rode east to tell Brigham Young they were in San Francisco and settled and ready to he
1 CONC lp them when they arrived. They met them in Wyoming and rode with them to Salt Lake City, where Brigham Young said this is where they should stop.  Frustrated Samuel Brannan left back for California in August of 1847.  
1 CONT John’s mother had convinced his brothers and sisters to leave the Church over how she had been treated and tried many times to have John leave also.  He wouldn’t.  
1 CONT He was working for Brannan as Associate Editor of “The California Star” newspaper.  Wanting to become the editor himself.  When this didn’t happen and it was published gold had been discovered he left publishing and began mining on the Americ
1 CONC an River.  It seems that his mother and sister were mining also and they did well enough to provide them with some money to improve their conditions.  John planned to use it to travel to Utah as the Saints had been asked to come there from Californ
1 CONC ia. 
1 CONT He learned that a group from the Mormon Battalion was forming to return and joined them.  At this time records show he contributed to the purchasing of two brass cannons from Captain John A. Sutter to be taken to Great Salt Lake.  He joined the Jon
1 CONC athan H. Holmes/Samuel Thompson Company of 1848 of 44 men and 1 woman for Salt Lake City.  39 of the group were Mormon Battalion veterans.  They left Sutter’s Fort May of 1848 and constructed wagon roads over Carson Pass later used by many heade
1 CONC d to California.  It was hard!  They arrived in Salt Lake City September 6, 1848.   
1 CONT In 1849, the summer after he arrived in Utah, John Eagar met Sariah Johnson, and they married in Salt Lake City on July 1. In the fifteen years together they had together, they had eight children. Anna Sariah 1850, John Thomas 1851, both born in Sa

1 CONT John served as City Clerk for twelve years and also as a printer which was his main profession. He only lived to be forty years old.  He passed away on March 3, 1864. He is buried in Manti Cemetery.

1 CONT Eagar was settled by John's three sons, John Thomas Eagar (Dec 20, 1851 - March 12, 1942) Joel and William Eagar and another family named Robertson. They received deed to the land in 1878.
1 CONT  
1 CONT However, the land was too high for ditch water to reach it until the "BIG DITCH" was built to bring water high enough to irrigate the land.
1 CONT  
1 CONT George Henry Crosby spearheaded the effort by the Mormons to build a ditch high enough to irrigate a larger area of Round Valley, higher than the small ditches then used in Springerville. Mormon leaders sent him to what was then called "Amity" beca
1 CONC use he had been a Sheriff in St. George Utah before and there were a lot of lawless gangs in the area. To irrigate "Eagar", even though it was not called that at the time, he had no dynamite, so the Mormons in the area had to heat basalt volcanic r
1 CONC ocks with fires, bring cold water from the river to pour over the hot rocks to break them, then drag the smaller rocks to the river to dam the river and create the Greer Lakes. Then the Mormons built the almost thirty mile "BIG DITCH" to travel th
1 CONC e approximately 6 miles, as the bird flies, distance to the top of round valley above "Eagar." George Crosby's own 18-year-old son was killed by a shovel over his head in a skirmish with another Mormon boy, while building the ditch. During this tim
1 CONC e, the Clanton Gang, after the shoot out at O-Kay Corral, settled in "water canyon" south of Eagar. Ike Clanton was eventually killed in water canyon, less than one mile above the southernmost extent of the big ditch.
1 CONT  
1 CONT The first postmisstress, Emma Goldsbrough Udall, wanted to name the town Union, in a desire for eventually combining the town with other towns such as Amity and Springerville, to unite the small community. However, the US postmaster general rejecte
1 CONC d the name as too common. Therefore, she submitted the name "Eagarville" to honor the Eager brothers. However, that name was also changed by the postmaster general to just Eagar sometime before December 1892 when the school district was renamed.[6]
1 CONT  
1 CONT A battle took place near what is now the town cemetery in which 9 members of the Snider gang were killed.[

1 CONT DIED - EAGAR -- In Monterey, December 1, Mrs. Lucy Eagar, a native of New York, aged 84 years, 2 months, and 7 days.
0 @N36@ NOTE === Life Sketch ===
1 CONT Lucy Buell had been born 23 September 1803 in Auburn, Cayuga, New York to Joseph Buell and Hannah Rider.  Lucy was the fourth in a family of five children, three girls and two boys.  
1 CONT She met and fell and married a young man from Ireland named Thomas Eagar. They were married  in 1822 in Auburn, Cayuga, New York. 
1 CONT Thomas had married a young girl named Mary Ann Leonard in 1820 who unfortunately died along with their son died during childbirth on 5 June 1821. Thomas was working as a brick and stone mason building the prison at Auburn when he met and married Lu
1 CONC cy.  
1 CONT Thomas and Lucy made their home in Auburn for a time and Lucy’s first child, John Eagar was born July 13, 1823 and a year later Elizabeth was born October 15, 1824.  
1 CONT About this time the father’s work on the prison at Auburn ended and they sold their property and moved to Sing-Sing where Thomas had a long-term position building the new Federal prison.  Much of his mason work survives today in the prison walls
1 CONC . then later moved to Sing-Sing where Thomas also operated a small hotel there. 
1 CONT Lucy had three more girls and three more boys while living in Sing Sing; Lucy November 26, 1827, Mary July 29, 1827, Thomas March 1, 1830, Arabella July 1, 1832, William and Walter (twins) July 1, 1835. Walter lived only about four months.
1 CONT Tragedy would strike again in a few years as Lucy’s husband, Thomas, died unexpectedly on June 9, 1841.
1 CONT Lucy was now a widow at 38 with seven children to raise.  They struggled for a number of years but somehow made ends meet for her family.  
1 CONT While living in the Sing Sing/Mt. Pleasant area still, Lucy heard about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from missionaries that were traveling through the area. She and her children joined the Church.  
1 CONT Story has it that she heard some doctrine from William Smith about eternal marriage and plural wives, the story goes that there had been instructions from Church headquarters in Nauvoo not to talk about these subjects. This will lead to an inciden
1 CONC t that occurred in Lucy’s life later in her story.
1 CONT Lucy’s oldest John had started to work for Samuel Brannan who had been working on different publications for the Church. Brannan had obtained permission to take a group of Saints by boat around Cape Horn to go West when the Saints in Nauvoo wer
1 CONC e preparing to head west by wagon.
1 CONT Lucy and John and her children except her two oldest daughters joined Brannan as 238 Latter Day Saints sailed aboard the ship Brooklyn on a 24,000 mile journey around Cape Horn of South America to the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii) and then to Californi
1 CONC a.  They left on February 4, 1846, just by coincidence the same day saints first crossed the Mississippi River for the West.    Much can be read about this voyage elsewhere.  As referred to earlier, doctrines she had heard from missionaries earlie
1 CONC r in life were discussed on board one day. Lucy and 3 others were excommunicated by Samuel Brannan  for “promoting” what he considered “false and dangerous doctorines”, something that hurt her and she drifted away from the Church the rest o
1 CONC f her life. Many on the ship felt this was wrong and was a brash abuse of his authority.
1 CONT Sadly her daughter Lucy she never saw again.  Daughter Elizabeth and her husband George Birdsall came to California during the Gold Rush in the year 1853.They remained there as Elizabeth records show Elizabeth died in 1876 in San Francisco.
1 CONT Back to Lucy, after she had been excommunicated by Samuel Brannan she stayed away from the Church and most other members, except for a good friend Fanny Corwin. Lucy eventually convinced all her children except John to leave the Church after arrivi
1 CONC ng at Yerba Buena.
1 CONT Lucy started a small dress shop and tried to make a living for her family. She soon fell out of favor with others in the area and helped her daughter Mary move to Monterey, California where Mary was a schoolteacher.  Son John had again been employe
1 CONC d by Samuel Brannan working on The California Star which was hard on Lucy. John felt the need to get away from Brannan.  
1 CONT Lucy reopened shop in San Francisco and eventually had enough money to purchase a lot when they went up for sale.  
1 CONT When Brannan’s new papare finally announced the discovery of gold on the streets of San Francisco, Lucy and her daughter Arabella were some of the first to travel to the mines and try their luck  near Sutter’s Fort, probably at Natoma. John joi
1 CONC ned them in June 1848 after The California Star ceased publication. In 1848 Lucy and her daughter Arabella were panning for gold near Sutter’s Fort when a Mr. Surman offered them a ride to Utah, Lucy was not interested.  
1 CONT It has been written that “Among the thousands of hurrying gold seekers, a few letter writers and diary keepers sensed history in the making. One of those most aware was Lieutenant William Tecumseh Sherman, who wrote a series of letters in the fal
1 CONC l of 1848 from the forks of the American River, where he had been sent by Governor Mason. As part of his official correspondence he described the curious human story unfolding, with its busy riverside comings and goings, its successes and expectati
1 CONC ons; he wrote of ‘Mrs. Eagar who won*t move till she has made $20,000,”. 
1 CONT How successful Lucy and her daughter were in the gold mines is not known, but she did return to San Francisco and continued with her shop.  
1 CONT Lucy was sad that she could not dissuade John from remaining with the Mormon Church and that John had chosen to leave California and travel to Utah with the Holmes-Thompson company of returning Mormon Battalion veterans in 1849.  
1 CONT About this time Lucy to purchased property in Benicia from Thomas O. Larkin. Her son Thomas had also purchased land in Benicia and this might also have drawn her to make the transaction.  
1 CONT Her daughter Arabella stayed with her mother most of the time.  Lucy continued working her little shop but she struggled to pay for the supplies. 
1 CONT Lucy and Arabella took a steamer named the Constitution on January 18, 1851 for Monterey to visit their family. Arabella met a young artist and fell in love.  They were married in 1851.
1 CONT Lucy returned to San Francisco after the wedding to continue with her little shop. This is when her daughter Elizabeth, in answer to one of Lucy’s letters, arrived in California.
1 CONT Lucy married again in California to William John Sweasey November 2, 1853. Sweasey was a member elect of the Legislature f California. The marriage didn’t last even a year before they were separated and Lucy took up residence with her son Willia
1 CONC m in Alameda.  The 1860 census shows her living there with William and her grandson James Knapp under the name of Lucy Sweasey.  
1 CONT She moved back to San Francisco in the 1860's and there until the time of her death on December 1,1888.  Her daughter Mary had her mother buried in the Milton Little family plot at Monterey and took her body back there for burial.

1 CONT Many sites have perpetuated the error that Dorothy James married a George Greswold and had various children who came to America. The available records do not support this. Dorothy James married Henry Greswold in Belbroughton, Warwickshire in 1592
1 CONC . They did have a son George (as well as Humphrey and William). However, George was only about 13 years old (i.e., born ca 1588) when his father died in 1601/2. George died about 1615. George was presumably unmarried as no mention is made of a wif
1 CONC e or children and all of his property (including Greet Hill) went to his brother Humphrey. His father was born in 1563 (his mother, Dorothy, is reputed to have been born about 1567 and died in 1656). Thus they could not have had a son George born i

1 CONT The George Greswold mentioned in the eleventh generation in the Visitation of Warwickshire, 1619, may be the father of Edward Griswold, who emigrated from Kenilworth, England, to Windsor, Conn. in 1639. It is clear from a deposition made by Captai
1 CONC n George Griswold that the great grandfather's name was George Griswold, who had three sons, Edward, Matthew and Thomas. There is thus the possibility that George Griswold, father of Edward and Matthew, is to be identified with the George Griswol
1 CONC d of the eleventh generation. More than this possibility, or at most probability, cannot be affirmed as yet. The Kenilworth parish records prior to 1630, which might have settled the question, were destroyed during the wars of the Commonwealth, an
1 CONC d the Griswold family in England has become extinct. There are facts enough, however, to make the connection between the Griswolds, of Windsor, Conn. and the Greswold heraldic family of Kenilworth and Solihull, Warwickshire, at least possible if no

1 CONT The present Clinton, Connecticut is the original Killingworth.[11]
1 CONT There have in the past been incorrect indentifications of Edwards parentage. In 1943, Glenn E. Griswold reported, "In the study of the life of Edward Griswold, the American ancestor, it must be kept in mind that we have at present no authentic reco

1 CONT "Her gravestone is the oldest now standing in the Clinton Congregational burying-ground. It is marked "M. G. 1670". It is reported by some one that Margaret's maiden name was Hicks, on what authority it is not known to us."[17]
1 CONT "Various names have been given to Margaret, the wife, but let it be understood that this is without any authority cited, and that no records thus far found have disclosed her name or parentage; and to set forth something of such importance withou
1 CONC t positive authority only results in confusion and disappointment. For many years search to solve this question has continued by brilliant historians, without success."[19]
1 CONT "EDWARD. Born in England, 1607; m. there about 1630, MARGARET, whose family name and parentage have not been disclosed; neither have we actual records of his birth and marriage."[10]

1 CONT "He was born in England in 1607; m. there about 1630, Margaret, whose surname is unknown. She died Aug. 23, 1670. Her uncut gravestone, marked "M.G. 1670," is readily discernable and is said to be the oldest in the cemetery at Clinton, Conn."[7]

1 CONT (Short version:) Sariah Anna Johnson was born Feb 18, 1832, in Ohio, to Joel Hills Johnson and Anna Pixley Johnson, early LDS converts. When Sariah was eight, her mother died, and then her father remarried.
1 CONT Her childhood was in the areas of Kirtland, Carthage, and Nauvoo. The family experienced mob persecution. They were close friends of Joseph Smith. Sariah sat on Joseph's knee, and received blessings from him. Several years later, the Johnsons move
1 CONC d to Utah with the Saints. Sariah spoke of driving the ox team and wagon.
1 CONT The next summer, Sariah, a 17-year-old, married 26-year-old John Eagar, in Salt Lake City. They had eight children. After they had been married for 15 years, John passed away.
1 CONT She and her children left their nice house, to pioneer southern Utah, living in dugouts. Sariah married Andrew Jackson Workman two years later. She raised 16 children total (her eight, Workman's three, and their five.)
1 CONT She served as Relief Society president for 20 years, and taught Sunday School. Her second husband died in 1909, leaving her a widow for her last 16 years. She had a lifelong testimony of the Gospel. She lived to be 93 years old, and is buried in Hu
1 CONC rricane, UT.
1 CONT __ (Longer version:)____________
1 CONT 
1 CONT Sariah Anna Johnson was born February 18, 1832 at Amhurst, Lorain County, Ohio, to Joel Hills Johnson and Anna Pixley Johnson. 
1 CONT Sariah was the third of five children.  Her oldest sister died after a few months.  Her siblings are Sixtus, Ellis 1829, Nephi 1833, Susan Ellen 1836, and Seth 1839. 
1 CONT Her parents had been living in New York, her father Joel left with another young man to find opportunities.  They soon decided to build a saw mill together in Amherst Ohio and moved their young families there in January of 1831. While there the fam
1 CONC ily met missionaries for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and Anna decided to join in May of 1831.  Joel didn’t decide to until June. Sariah Anna was their first child born in Ohio.    
1 CONT The Mother, Anna Pixley Johnson whose name before and after marriage was Johnson, died 11 September 1840 at Macedonia, Illinois (near Nauvoo). After the Mothers death the Father, Joel Hills Johnson, married Susan Bryant. They were driven around b
1 CONC y mobs and Sariah Anna went to live with her Grandmother Julia Hills Johnson.  Her next two siblings were born in Kirtland Ohio.  Troubles arose with believers of the Church and non-believers and they were soon forced to flee Ohio. 
1 CONT In January of 1839 her family moved to Carthage Illinois where her youngest brother was born.  Her father served as a local church leader there.  
1 CONT Her mother and many of her siblings and probably Sariah herself became sick with fever and chills “ague”.  This was what they called malaria.  An alarming number of the new settlers to the area suffered from malaria from 1839-1845.  Sariah an
1 CONC d her siblings recovered, their mother did not.  At barely over 40, Sariah’s mother died in Ramus Illinois in 1840.  Sariah was only eight years old. Her ranged from eleven to one years old.    
1 CONT Sariah’s father married Susan Bryant soon after, she also raised a large family of her own.
1 CONT Turmoil with the Church members and the non-members worsened in Illinois soon just as in Ohio, and soon after the martyrdom of Joseph Smith and Hyrum at nearby Carthedge, it soon became necessary to leave with the rest of the Saints to the West.  S
1 CONC ariah’s father took her and their family West to Winter Quarters Nebraska and joined the Willard Richard’s Company of 1848.  Sariah was now 16.  They arrived in Salt Lake City in October of 1848.
1 CONT Sariah Anna Johnson married John Eagar in Salt Lake City on July 1, 1849. John Eagar was a man of education, a printer by trade. He became acquainted with the authorities of the Church in New York City where he assisted in printing a paper for them
1 CONC . He was one of those who went on the ship Brooklyn around to San Francisco and from there by land to Utah.
1 CONT John Eagar and Sariah Anna Johnson had the following children: Anna Sariah Eagar 1850, John Thomas 1851, William Walter 1853, Julia Hills 1855, Joel Sixtus 1858, Susan Elizabeth 1860, 
1 CONT Benjamin Franklin 1862, and Mary Elvira 1863.
1 CONT Sariah and John lived in Salt Lake City for about three years and then were called to settle in Manti Utah.  
1 CONT This is where there six youngest were born.  
1 CONT In 1864 her husband John became sick and died.  This left Sariah at 32 years old a widower in a tough western frontier with eight young children.  On his deathbed John had made her promise she would leave Manti and go live with her parents and fami
1 CONC ly in Virgin Utah where they were called to settle.  She did.
1 CONT In 1866 Sariah married Andrew Jackson Workman and continued living in Virgin Utah.  She and Andrew had Amos Jackson 1866, Nephi Johnson 1868, Charles Adelbert 1870, Edwin Monroe 1872, and Jacob Louis 1874.
1 CONT So Sariah raised sixteen children. She served as President of the Relief Society for about twenty years in Virgin Utah and a Sunday School Teacher for nine years.
1 CONT About 1908, Sariah and Andrew moved to Hurricane, Utah. Andrew died June 15, 1909. 
1 CONT Sariah lived alone but her grandchildren stayed with her at night. 
1 CONT Sariah used to love to tell her grandchildren how she used to sit on the Prophet Joseph's lap and he would give her blessings. She also would tell about when she drove a yoke of oxen across the plains in the Willard Richards Company, when her famil
1 CONC y came to the "Valley".  She said she was at the meeting when the mantle of the Prophet Joseph fell on Brigham Young, and her testimony of the occasion was very strong. She bore a strong testimony of the Gospel as long as she lived. 
1 CONT Sariah died March 27, 1925, and is buried in the Hurricane Cemetery.

1 CONT company from the eastern part of Connecticut set out on
1 CONT a journey to New Haven. They met Mr. lugersoU at
1 CONT "Wethersfleld, when they compelled him to again resign
1 CONT and cry out three times, " Liberty and Property." The

1 CONT An Account of the Manner in which a Stamp Officer was
1 CONT obliged to resign.
1 CONT " Last Wednesday afternoon a large company of able-bodied men came
1 CONT to town (on horse-back) from the eastern part of this government, and informed
1 CONT those who were willing to join them, that they were on their way
1 CONT to New Haven to demand the stamp officer of the colony to resign his
1 CONT office ; that a number of their associates had gone on the lower roads, and
1 CONT that they had all agreed to rendezvous at Brandford the next day (,Thursday)
1 CONT , and that they should tarry in town that night : they then dispersed to
1 CONT different parts of the town for lodging. In the evening advice was received
1 CONT that Mr. IngersoU was on the road to this place, —that he would be
1 CONT in town next day, and that he intended to apply to the assembly for their
1 CONT protection; and it being conjectured that he might come to town in the
1 CONT night to shun the mob, (who he heard were on their way to pay him a visit)
1 CONT ,
1 CONT it was agreed that a watch should patrol the streets all night, to prevent
1 CONT his coming in unnoticed, but they made no discoveries. On Thursday
1 CONT morning, the whole body (including a considerable number from this
1 CONT town,) set off on the intended expedition, and in about an hour, met Mr.
1 CONT IngersoU at the lower end of Wethersfleld, and let him know their business.
1 CONT He at first refused to comply ; but it was insisted upon that he should
1 CONT resign his office of stamp master, so disagreeable to his countrymen.
1 CONT After many proposals he delivered the resignation mentioned below, which
1 CONT he read himself in the hearing of the whole company. He was then
1 CONT desired to pronounce the words, Liberty and Property, three times, which
1 CONT he having done, the whole body gave three cheers. Mr. IngersoU then
1 CONT went to a tavern, and dined with several of the company. After dinner,
1 CONT the company told Mr. IngersoU, as he was bound to Hartford, they would
1 CONT escort him there, which they did to the number of 500 persons, on horse back. After they arrived in town, Mr. Ingersoll again read his resignation
1 CONT in public, when three liuzzas were given, and the whole company immediately
1 CONT dispersed, without making the least disturbance." {The Connecticut
1 CONT Courant, September 23, 1765, publishedin Hartford, Conn.)
1 CONT The following is a copy of Mr. IngersoU's resignation : —
1 CONT Wethersfield, Sept. 19th, 1765.
1 CONT I do hereby promise that I never will receive any stampt papers
1 CONT which may arrive from Europe, in consequence of any Act passed in the
1 CONT Parliament of Great Britain, nor officiate in any manner as Stamp Master,
1 CONT or distributor of stamps within the Colony of Connecticut, directly or
1 CONT indirectly. And I do hereby notify all the inhabitants of his majesty's
1 CONT Colony of Connecticut, (notwithstanding the said office or trust has been

1 CONT Anna Sariah Eager Tenney  was born May 29, 1850 in Millcreek, now part of Salt Lake City.  Her father is John Eager and her mother is Sariah Johnson.
1 CONT They soon moved to Manti, Utah, where John was a leader.  He held positions his education made possible.  But John was not well.  He passed away in 1864 leaving Sariah with eight children.
1 CONT Sariah sold her lovely home and  farm and moved to Virgin City in Southern Utah to be near her family.  Two years later she married Andrew Jackson Workman and added four more children to her family.
1 CONT In that day everybody worked, Anna being the oldest was the family weaver.  She wove nearly everything they wore and even their carpet.  
1 CONT Nine miles away in Toquerville lived a young man, Ammon M. Tenney.  They met and soon made plans to marry.  She was seventeen when she was married, November 6, 1867.  Their first home was in Toquerville.  Two of their children were born there.  The
1 CONC n Ammon was called to Kanab to be nearer his work which was interpreter for Jacob Hamblin.  Three more babies came at Kanab.
1 CONT Anna often mentioned plural marriage to Ammon, but he paid no attention.  As time went on she began to bring it up frequently.  Anna said, “I knew it would bring a blessing and I wanted it.”  So one day Ammon looked up and said, “I know it i
1 CONC s true because I know the Gospel is true.  But who would we have?”  Anna said, “There is someone for us.”  The next time she mentioned the subject she he said, “Well, if you want to do it I’ll tell you what we will do.  You find her.  I
1 CONC f you do, it will be someone you will love and you will get along nicely together and I would rather have that than anything.”  Anna said, “Ammon, she will be your wife the same as I am, and I can’t find you a wife.”  Then Ammon said, “Yo
1 CONC u know I don’t care.  We are getting along nicely the way we are.  I am perfectly satisfied, but if you want to it’s all right.  Only you must find her.”  So each night when he came home he would ask, “Have you found anyone?”  “No, sh
1 CONC e will be your wife, so you must find her,” was Anna’s reply.  That went on several days.  One night he asked and was quite cross with her reply that she had not found anyone.  “Now tomorrow you dress up and get out and get acquainted,” Amm
1 CONC on suggested.  Anna only smiled but the very next night Ammon came in all excited.  “I think I have seen her,” Ammon said.  She was Eliza Ann Udall.  These two good women lived together for eighteen years and never quarreled.  Eliza had two dau
1 CONC ghters only.
1 CONT June 20, 1876 Ammon was called to preside over the Indian Mission in New Mexico and Arizona.  So that he would be near his field of labor he moved his family to St. Johns, Arizona.  Anna was a family nurse.  
1 CONT For a while the family lived at Savoita, New Mexico.  This was near the Indians and it seemed to be their favorite pastime to stand just outside the door and look in.  One morning two squaws and a very large buck came in.  Anna gave the children th
1 CONC eir breakfast, too nervous to sit down with them.  She noticed that the squaws were gone but the man still stayed.  One of the children dropped his spoon.  Anna gave him another.  Then she had to go to the other room and when she returned the spoo
1 CONC n was gone.  What to do, she did not know, but she knew if she let him get away with it she was in real trouble.  She went to the stove and all at once she knew what she had to do.  In the wood box were lengths of wood to feed the fire.  She caugh
1 CONC t up one and took a hurried step or two holding the wood high, saying “Give me that spoon!”  A slow smile crossed the Indian’s face.  He put his hand under his blanket and gave her the spoon saying, “Brave squaw.”  And then he was gone.
1 CONT 	
1 CONT From Savoita they moved to Wind Mill Ranch.  Anna’s sixth child was born there.  But they soon moved back to St. Johns.  Ammon was released and expected to put his family in better condition financially.  Only a few days after his homecoming, Bis
1 CONC hop David K. Udall came to say that the people who had accepted plural marriage were being persecuted beyond endurance.  People were hedged in, couldn’t buy more land nor keep what they had in peace.  Something must be done.  He said it looked li
1 CONC ke it would have to be fought out in the court.  But, they couldn’t do anything with us because it was unconstitutional.
1 CONT 
1 CONT “It will take someone who can handle it.  Ammon, I want you to go,” said the Bishop.  Ammon looked up, surprised but never hesitated, “All right, David, if you want me to go, I will.”  Ammon did.  He was duly arrested with three others, sto
1 CONC od trial and was sentenced to three years six months in prison hard labor and given an $8,000 fine.  This was in the U.S. House of Correction in Detroit, Michigan.  While he was gone Eliza went to Nephi, Utah to her people.  Anna’s eighth child
1 CONC , Rosalia, was two weeks old when Ammon left.  Anna went to the farm in the summer and back to St. Johns to put the children in school in the winter.  
1 CONT In a little less than two years, President Grover Cleveland pardoned all four in October 17, 1886.  
1 CONT Ammon had been home about one year when another call came for a mission.  This time it was for three years.  When he was released, President Wilford Woodruff told him to take his family and go to Old Mexico. Ammon went ahead to prepare the way.  I
1 CONC n 1890 Anna followed.  
1 CONT Ammon leased a saw mill in the Sierra Madre Mountains, built a large house and all the family lived there.  Soon summer was gone and they moved back to Colonia Dias.  Ammon decided to send Anna and the children back to St. Johns where they still ow
1 CONC ned a home and where the children could have a good school.  It was 600 miles there and 600 miles back again in the Spring.  They spent one more summer at the saw mill and then they moved back to Colonia Dias.  Ammon bought nine acres at the edge o
1 CONC f town with a one-room house on it.  Covered wagon boxes were lifted from the running gears and placed on timbers for bedrooms.  This did very well for a while.  Then Nathan, the second son, came home and built two more rooms
1 CONT The revolution in Old Mexico was getting worse.  The Americans were all driven out.  Anna came out with friends and little more than what she stood up in.  But in answer to sympathy she said, “The Lord is good.”
1 CONT She went to Southern Utah to see her mother, but they hadn’t seen each other for thirty years and neither recognized the other.  Anna stayed about one and one-half years there and then located in St. Johns. 
1 CONT Ammon died October 28, 1925.
1 CONT Anna later moved to Salt Lake City and lived with her daughter, Lois Lemmon, and spent several happy years working in the Temple.  She grew old and tired moved back to Thatcher, Arizona, where she died January 19, 1934.  She was the mother of ten c

1 CONT History of the Life of Julia Hills Eagar Johnson
1 CONT (Written by herself)
1 CONT 
1 CONT I was born December 20, 1855, at Manti City, Sanpete County. At that time, Utah was a Territory but later became a state. My father's name was John Eagar and my mother's was Sariah Anna Johnson Eagar. My birthplace was an old fort in Manti which ha
1 CONC d been put up as a piece of protection from the Indians. I recall playing about the fort. Later, Father built a seven-room house just across the road from it [the fort].
1 CONT There was plenty of trouble with Indians in those days. When they were on friendly terms with the settlers they used to beg for food, but when they weren't very friendly, we were very afraid of them.
1 CONT My father was a school teacher, and also a postmaster and tithing clerk. [Also, a printer, justice of the peace and probate judge.]
1 CONT His health would not permit him to do hard labor so he made his living by writing. Later he decided to move to Southern Utah to better his health. He sold out and prepared to go, but before we left, he died.
1 CONT Mother sent for her brother, Nephi Johnson, to take her to Southern Utah. There were nine in the family, so it took two wagons besides the light spring wagon my mother rode in.
1 CONT After we arrived we lived about from place to place and sometimes in dugouts.
1 CONT After we lived there for awhile we moved to North Creek, where my Grandfather [Joel Hills Johnson] had a mill. Mother brought a piece of land which enabled her to teach her two sons, John Thomas, and William Walter, how to farm.
1 CONT My sister Anna was the oldest and I never remember of her working in the fields.
1 CONT For many years, we lived there neighbors to Grandfather, who had three women and I lived among his wives.
1 CONT My mother's mother [Anna Pixley Johnson] died before mother was anything but a child. 
1 CONT After she died, Grandfather married a woman by the name of Susan, another named Janet, and other named Margaret. Aunt Margaret was the mother of the man known as Ezekiel Johnson. I remember some of the other children, but I can't recall their names
1 CONC , so I won't mention them. 
1 CONT I was very fond of my grandfather [Joel Hills Johnson] and I was always listening to every word he said. I remember hearing him say that when his father [Ezekiel Johnson] died, he called him to his bed and told him that he wished him to do this tem
1 CONC ple work for him. Also, that he had known always that there was a true Gospel, ever since he heard it, but that he was too stubborn to acknowledge it. He said he had waited too long and was unable to do it for himself, so he was asking my grandfath
1 CONC er, Joel Hills Johnson, to do his temple work for him.
1 CONT Grandfather did this work for him as soon as there was an opportunity. (That is why I could never understand why it was said that he never had his work done.).
1 CONT I learned most of the Gospel from my grandfather, and even though it was said he was of a cranky disposition, he never spoke a cross word to me.
1 CONT I remember distinctly at one time when he bid me goodbye with a blessing and said that he wanted me to be one of the best women on earth and I have always remembered it and keep it in my mind.
1 CONT I have always been prayerful ever since I can remember, and having no education, I have to depend on God for my help. I feel to acknowledge the hand of the Lord for every help and many different things in my childhood days, and also since I've grow
1 CONC n to womanhood.
1 CONT Between the age of fourteen and fifteen, I started on a trip to Salt Lake City with my two uncles and an aunt. The object of the trip was to become better acquainted with the folks in Salt Lake, and I made the trip at the request of the folks at ho
1 CONC me and my uncle.
1 CONT On our way we were going to stop at my Uncle Benjamin F. Johnson's, on his farm in Spring Lake Villa for a couple of weeks and my uncle's wife was to meet him there and all visit together. Before we got there, we stopped at the home of another uncl
1 CONC e, George Washington Johnson, for a few hours, while there one of our cousins, Horace Johnson, was sick in bed with the measles.
1 CONT I had never had the measles and therefore wasn't allowed to go in his room.
1 CONT After we got to Spring Lake we stayed for two weeks. Two loads of the folks went fishing at the Lake, but I had to stay at the house. My grandfather had five women only part of them went. I stayed with Sarah Melissa. 
1 CONT During the time they were gone my aunt and I were talking, another aunt, Harriett, came in the room and told us about Horace Johnson coming. A few minutes after she had left, Horace came in and met Aunt Melissa, after they had met, she gave me an i
1 CONC ntroduction to him.
1 CONT When I reached my hand to shake hands with him; someone said to me "There is the father of your children." I was very much plagued and the same voice said again, "Never mind no one knows but you." Since it never came to my mind again for years I kn
1 CONC ew it was a presentment.
1 CONT Years after I was married to this man, the same voice returned and repeated the message. I was at that time the mother of several children. Some years later the voice came again and I never forgot it after that.
1 CONT I never said anything to anyone about it for a number of years. It may have been until after all my children were born. This taught me that people have guardian angels. I believe it was because I was prayerful and relied on my Father in Heaven tha
1 CONC t I received that message concerning me. I also acknowledge his hand in many other manifestations which have helped to guide me right.
1 CONT The time I left Uncle Benjamin's, before I was married, I went to Salt Lake and stayed until the last of July. From there I went back to Mona with my grandmother and Aunt Susan. Uncle Jimmie was the teamster.
1 CONT I was to stay at Uncle George's until I could get a ride to Manti and from there home. While in Mona, I met Horace again. Horace's folks were well acquainted with mine, although I wasn't old enough to remember very well. They used to spend the wint

1 CONC h beginning in 1956 at the library of the New England Historic Genealogical Society in Boston, MA): 
1 CONT      Simon Newcomb, son of Lt. Andrew & Sarah Newcomb, probably was born in about 1666 on Hog Island, one of the Isles of Shoals group off the coast of Kittery, York, Maine, where his father was a fisherman.  It is believed that the family moved in
1 CONC to the town of Kittery when Simon was about four.  Following the death of his wife and the loss of a court case brought by John Cutt, Andrew Newcomb turned over his house and land in Kittery to John Cutt and moved with his motherless seven childre
1 CONC n to Edgartown on Martha's Vineyard Island in late 1674 or early 1675.
1 CONT      His father, Andrew Newcomb, was married to Anna Bayes in about 1676, providing Simon with a stepmother and a family of  eight half-siblings.  Apparently his father became a merchant in Edgartown and was involved in a number of land transaction
1 CONC s.
1 CONT      This Simon Newcomb may be the one who who owned land at Sagadahock, Maine in 1687 and who bought land at Salem, Maine in 1693.  If so, there appears to be no record of he and his family ever living in that part of Maine.  They were probably li
1 CONC ving on Martha's Vineyard Island, as he was named in the will of Wm. Vinson of Edgartown, 10 May 1690, as one to see that the provision of the will were faithfully executed.
1 CONT     On 13 March 1693/4, Simon Newcomb bought land on Martha's Vineyard.  He owned several shares of land upon the Island of Chappaquiddick, across the channel, and a short distance southeasterly from the village of Edgartown, where he kept large nu
1 CONC mbers of cattle and sheep - his mark a "slit on the Right Ear."  He purchased land from his father on 22 Jan 1701/2 adjoining Job's Neck Pond, four miles southwest of Edgartown.   Subsequently he bought and received a grant of additional adjoinin
1 CONC g lands, making it a large farm where he and his family lived for a number of years.
1 CONT He also owned lands at Swan Neck Point, and at other places, all on Martha's Vineyard.  Heserved as a member of various committees in town affairs; in May 1693 had "full power and order for the ordering of the sheep & cattle"; signed a venire as Co
1 CONC nstable of Chelmark, 1699 (according to Court Record); was chosen to settle bounds of lands in 1704; viewed lands to find Thomas Peas' dividend on 28 Jan 1705; found records of town's bounds 5 Mar. 1705-6; in 1710 he was chosen by his townsmen as "
1 CONC Field Driver" at Edgartown. 
1 CONT     Starting in 1711, Simon Newcomb began selling some of his property on Martha's Vineyard and purchasing property at Lebanon, New London, Connecticut.   He gave farms to each of his sons (except Simon, who received the homestead), the considerati
1 CONC on being "love, goodwill and affection." 
1 CONT Simon Newcomb took the Freeman's Oath at Lebanon and was elected highway surveyor in 1714. On 15 Sep 1714 he was one of a "Comity" of three for building "meetin" house in Hebron, and reported, 5 Oct. following, a proper site for it22. In 1718 he wa
1 CONC s chosen grand juryman; in 1721 he was appointed guardian to Caleb Jones and in 1741 was chosen fence viewer.
1 CONT      There is no verifiable evidence as to the origin, including her maiden name, of Deborah, wife of Simon Newcomb.  According to the inscription on her tombstone,  she was in 92nd year (means 91+, not yet 92) at time of her death in June 1756 - i
1 CONC ndicating that she was born in about 1665. Simon and Deborah probably were married in about 1687 in Edgartown, as their first child was born there about a year later.
1 CONT      The known children from this marriage were:
1 CONT  i. Deacon John Newcomb  was born cir 1688 in Edgartown MA  and died on 23 Feb 1765 in Cornwallis N.S. 
1 CONT  ii. Thomas Newcomb (1, 3, 5, 8)  was born in 1691-1692 in Edgartown MA, died in 1761 in Dutchess Co. NY, and was buried in Washington Hollow Cem., Dutchess Co. NY 
1 CONT  iii. Hezekiah Newcomb  was born on 26 May 1693 in Edgartown MA,was christened on 25 Dec 1716 in New London CT died on 15 Aug 1772 in Lebanon CT, and was buried in Jonathan Trumbull Cem., Lebanon CT.
1 CONT  iv. Obadiah Newcomb was born in 1695 in Edgartown MA, died on 24 May 1761 in Hebron CT, and was buried in Newcomb Farm, Hebron (now Andover) CT 
1 CONT  v. Deborah Newcomb  was born in 1696-1697 in Edgartown MA

1 CONT  ix. Simon Newcomb was born cir 1705 in Edgartown MA and died cir 1770 in Cornwallis N.S..

1 CONT      According to the inscription on his tombstone, Simon Newcomb died in Lebanon, CT on 20 Jan 1744/1745.  His Will written on 23 July 1741 is recorded in Windham County, CT Probate Records, Vol. 3, pages 169-172.  His estate was inventoried on 1

1 CONT Elizabeth P. White, FASG, FNGS, CG, died on January 3, 2011, aged 96 years, 8 months and 3 days in Wilmette, Illinois. Betty was a certified genealogist (certified in 1971), lecturer, and a published author in journals about Illinois and New Englan

1 CONT Here are some interesting highlights on the life and work of Elizabeth Pearson White (from Memorial Tribute – Elizabeth P. White FASG, FNGS, CG , The Mayflower Quarterly, Plymouth, MA, General Society of Mayflower Descendants March 2011, writte
1 CONC n by her son, Ronald White.):
1 CONT “At Springfield, in the Illinois State Archives, she discovered that many letters in the Benjamin Godfrey collection had lost their signature. Who had written to our ancestor? She brought this problem to the senior archivist Lowell M. Volkel, an
1 CONC d simultaneously they understood that the author was Abraham Lincoln.” (p. 25-26)
1 CONT “Betty White was involved in creating the Chicago Genealogical Society (1967) and the Illinois State Genealogical Society (1968), serving as vice-President in 1976 and Associate Editor of the Quarterly Journal from 1977-1981.” (p. 26)
1 CONT “For the Illinois State Genealogical Society at Springfield my mother arranged for the esteemed Milton Rubincam FASG to be the featured speaker about genealogical research. Arriving at the hotel she discovered her name and her topic posted on th
1 CONC e hotel’s marquee. My mother felt embarrassed, thinking that publicity should have favored the renowned elder of the American Society of Genealogists. Good that Milton was a true gentleman and the audience offered their enthusiastic applause.

1 CONT Notes for MARGARET HUGGINS:
1 CONT The following is documentation of an event in the life of Margaret Huggins:
1 CONT 
1 CONT On 13 May 1704, the village of Pascommuck, now within Easthampton, Mass, was destroyed by Indians. It had been settled only four or five years. For some reason a party of Indians had been to the Merrimac River, but had not accomplished their purpos
1 CONC e. They directed their course towards Westfield. Westfield River was so swollen by raines, they could not pass it. They had been unable to obtain food and some knew of the situation at Pascommuchk, so they determined as last resort to descend upo
1 CONC n this village to satisfy hunger and their natural ferocity. They took in the situation at the village from the mountain, and made their plans. On 24 May just before daybreak they descended, and made their attack on the unexpected inhabitants.
1 CONT Defense was attempted at the house of Benoni Jones, which was encompassed with pickets. The surprise was so complete that the savages, aided by fire, soon overpowered and killed nineteen or twenty. Nine persons by the name of Jones were slain. Th
1 CONC e wife of the Jones man was taken to the top of Pomeroy Mountain, and there was knocked in the head and scalped, probably left for dead. She was carried on a litter to North Hampton. The husband succeeded in eluding the savages in a little ravine h
1 CONC idden by bushes. He ran through this and reaches the water where he found a skiff, and headed out to Northampton, where he announced the news. Benoni Jones was killed in the attack.
1 CONT The red skins arrived back in Canada with three captives: John Searl, Margaret Huggins, and her aunt Mrs. Benoni (Ester) Jones. Margaret was about sixteen years old at the time. The aunt died after reaching Montreal, Canada, at the Hotel - Dieu. Af
1 CONC ter a time, John Searl and Margaret Huggins were redeemed by the English authorities, but not before they had been baptized into the Roman Catholic Church as the following account shows:
1 CONT "Coleman: New England Captives carried to Canada, (1926)" On Sunday, 17September1706 was baptized by me, undersigned priest, born Stony Brook in New England, 1686, of marriage of Experience Jones and Jean (John) Huggins, baptized later (4 months)
1 CONC , and brought to Saint Francois by Mons. le Gar de-Magazin on the King and Godmother Damoiseile Boriat, wife of Monsieur Poscand, merchant, who have all signed according to Law.

0 @N1766@ NOTE Some of the information found here has since been questioned or found incorrect, such as the Phelps family coming from Tewkesbury when all the other recruits were from Dorset and Somerset counties.  This information was most likely taken fr
1 CONC om “The Phelps Family in America” which has been discussed.  Some sources even contend George Phelps actually arrived a few years later, probably on the Recovery in 1634.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Also the information about Joseph Clark as Frances’ first husband is not correct.  “The Great Migration” states her husband was not Joseph Clark.  The Joseph Clark family used here is also found in “The Great Migration” under Joseph Clark
1 CONC , but his wife died in April 1639, after Frances had married Thomas Dewey, and the children listed here are not correct for Frances.  Joseph Clark’s son Joseph died in 1659 only mentioning his sister, Mary, as next of kin in his Will, and she wa
1 CONC s yet unmarried. (She married Joseph Bird late 1659 or early 1660.)  This #1 Joseph who married Alice Pepper is from a third Clark family altogether.  #2 Hannah who married Hopkins was born (rather than married) in 1660, and was the granddaughter o
1 CONC f Frances, the daughter of Mary.  #3 Mary is the only child of Frances and Mr. Clark that is correct.  Mary 1638-1663 married in 1656 John, the son of John Strong.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The rest of the Phelps family information seems to be correct.
1 CONT 
1 CONT GEORGE PHELPS arrived in Dorchester, and then moved to Windsor, CT in 1635.  He married in 1637, Phillury, the daughter of Phillip Randall.  She died in 1648, and he married a second time, Frances Dewey, widow of both Clark and Thomas Dewey.  Thi

0 @N1767@ NOTE Descendants of George Phelps, the Emigrant
1 CONT 
1 CONT This history perpetuates the idea that George was a son of William Phelps of Tewkesbury, which we know has been disproven.  [Either George arrived on the Mary and John in 1630, or as others believe, he sailed from Weymouth, Dorset, England in 1634
1 CONC , as best can be determined, aboard the Recovery.]  He came to Windsor in 1635, and married Phillury Randall there in 1637.  She died in 1648, and he then married in 1648, the widow Frances Dewey, being her third husband.  
1 CONT 
1 CONT This claims her first husband was a Joseph Clark, by whom she had one daughter, Mary Clark, who married John Strong, Jr.  Mr. Clark was the son of one of three brothers, William, Thomas, or George, of whom Harris says:  “These three bro’s wer
1 CONC e in Dorchester in 1630, where they died soon and nearly at the same time.  A gravestone was erected to their memory with this inscription: ‘Here lie three Clarkes; their accounts are even, Entered on earth and carried up to Heaven.’  (Possibly
1 CONC , her first husband was a Joseph Clark, but he was not the Joseph Clark who died in 1641 leaving children Joseph and Mary who married Joseph Bird in 1659 as discussed in “The Great Migration”.)
1 CONT 
1 CONT She married second in 1638 or 9, Thomas Dewey, who came from Sandwich, England, to Dorchester, 1633, and to Windsor in 1638, where he died 27 Mar 1648, leaving five children; his widow married third Mr. Phelps, as above, and, with him and her own c
1 CONC hildren, removed to Westfield, Mass., where she died 27 Sept 1690. His removal from Windsor to Westfield was probably about 1670.

1 CONT Joseph Horace was the first son of George Washington Johnson and Eveline Burdick Johnson. He was born in Kanesville (now Council Bluffs), Iowa, June 13, 1850. According to his father's writings, they left for Salt Lake City the day Horace was a yea
1 CONC r old on June 13, 1851. The family arrived in the Salt Lake Valley in the fall of 1851.
1 CONT The family stayed in Salt Lake for a short time. His father's mission was to help build new towns. They moved a great deal when he was young. They moved to Springville and lived there about three years. They then moved to Payson and then a short di
1 CONC stance to Santaquin. This was abandoned because of Indian difficulties. The next move was to Cedar City. They built a fort there and stayed for a number of years. Horace attended his first school there. After several years, the family moved to Sanp
1 CONC ete County. At Uintah Springs, now called Fountain Green, George Washington Johnson, Amos and Horace Johnson, James Holman, Silas and Sanford Holman were the first six men to build houses there. Horace was about 15 or 16 years of age then. They cle
1 CONC ared land for farms and built a settlement. Here Horace attended his last school.
1 CONT During the Black Hawk War, Horace was an express rider, as well as an Indian interpreter. Ranger, a Morgan mare, and Jingle Bob were the horses of his express string. When the railroad was being built through Weber Canyon in 1867, he worked on th
1 CONC e railroad until April of 1868 when he and a couple of friends went to Nevada to join in the White Pine Gold Rush. He returned to Mona in the fall of 1869 and worked on the railroad again and was preparing to go back to Nevada. His plans and life w
1 CONC ere changed when he fell in love with and married Julia Hills Eagar, his second cousin. They were married August 25, 1870, by his father in his home in Mona, Utah. There were about 150 guests at the wedding.
1 CONT It was the custom at that time for the groom to bear all the expenses of the wedding. Horace took the money he saved to go back to White Pine and used this money to pay for the wedding. It was also not the custom to give wedding presents at that ti
1 CONC me. The couple was expected to start out on "their own hook." His mother gave him a present—a lead pencil and some of the best advice anyone could receive—"keep your accounts straight in life."
1 CONT The first year of their marriage, Horace worked on the stage line and in Tintic. When they were married almost a year, a baby daughter was still-born. Julia was very ill. Horace became concerned about her condition, especially when his grandmothe
1 CONC r warned him that Julia might die if he left her alone while he was on his job at Tintic. He took her with him. She was so weak that he had to carry her around for a week or ten days. He would carry her to a spring seat by the fire, fix their meals
1 CONC , then carry her to bed. She began to improve and in a week or so she was able to do the cooking. They had to leave Tintic because the smelter closed. The operators swindled people out of their money and left town.
1 CONT Then Horace worked on the stage line in Nephi. He hauled timber from the canyon on shares. He was able to buy two city lots and haul enough lumber to build a one-room log house by the end of the summer of 1872. In December of that year, Sariah Evel
1 CONC ine was born. She was named for both of her grandmothers. During that winter, Horace worked at shoemaking and harness mending. In the summer, he worked in wood and charcoal for Tintic. He also worked on the railroad and in the fall he worked harves
1 CONC ting in the fields.
1 CONT There were two very long and hard winters in Mona, Utah, 1879-80 and 1880-81. The stockmen ran out of cattle feed and the farmers took the stock to feed until they also ran out of feed. Nearly everyone lost most of their stock the first winter. Dur
1 CONC ing the second winter, a diphtheria epidemic broke out and several children died. The Johnsons lost two young sons, Horace Edward and John Almon.
1 CONT Horace Johnson worked at a sawmill near Mona and was engaged in the cattle business there until 1883, when he and Julia and their young family left Mona with three or four other families and headed for northern New Mexico. Nine wagons made up the l
1 CONC ittle company. It was a slow difficult trip. They passed through Moab and LaSalle. When they arrived at their destination, the land was not what was promised. They spent a difficult winter there and then journeyed back to the Moab area. They settle
1 CONC d on Poverty Flat and built a log home. Farming on the Flat in the early days was very good. The main crop was grain, wheat, oats and barley. Once they invested more in cattle, they raised alfalfa. Watermelons used to "volunteer"—or they came u
1 CONC p wherever seeds were flipped. This was a joy for the children. Fruit and grapes were abundant. Horace Johnson was active in public affairs in Grand County. He was a county commissioner for many years. In the early 1930s, the Johnsons moved from th
1 CONC eir ranch on the Flat and built a comfortable home in town.
1 CONT Horace and Julia Hills Johnson were the last surviving pioneer couple residing at Moab. In August of 1935, they celebrated their 64th wedding anniversary. The last family gathering held at their home was December 20, 1935, when a family party was g
1 CONC iven in honor of Julia's 79th birthday. Just one month later, January 19, 1935, Horace in Moab died at the age of 84.

1 CONT Ammon was born to Nathan Cram Tenney and Olive Strong.
1 CONT 
1 CONT His mother, and then his father, joined the Mormon church in the early 1840s, when Ammon was a very young child.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The family had been living in Nauvoo, Illinois, but then moved to Lee County, Iowa, across the Mississippi river from Nauvoo, about 1844.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Ammon's family left with the main body of Mormons when they left Nauvoo to go to Winter Quarters (Florence), Nebraska in 1846. In 1848, the family left Winter Quarters and traveled by wagon train to Utah, where they settled in Cottonwood, Grand Cou
1 CONC nty, Utah. The family later lived in San Bernardino, California, southern Utah, and Arizona. 
1 CONT 
1 CONT Ammon learned to speak Spanish in California and used that skill to act as a Mormon missionary and scout in the Southwest United States. He spent most of his life as a Mormon missionary in Arizona, New Mexico, and Mexico.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Ammon was a polygamist; by 1872 he had two wives. In 1884, he was arrested and convicted of polygamy; he was sentenced to 3 1/2 years in the Detroit House of Corrections. He had served over two years of his sentence when he was pardoned by Presiden
1 CONC t Cleveland.
1 CONT 
1 CONT In 1890, Ammon wanted to take a third polygamous wife; to do so he had to go to Mexico, because the Mormon church had promised the federal government they would not continue practicing polygamy, although they did to some extent. Polygamy was also i
1 CONC llegal in Mexico, but the Mexican government did not spend much time proscecuting people who practiced it.
1 CONT 
1 CONT After bringing all his wives to Mexico, in 1890, his first wife, Anna, separated from him because of his abusive treatment of her and the children.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Anna and her children continued to live in Colonia Diaz, Mexico, while Ammon and his other two wives moved to Colonia Dublan and other places in Mexico. In 1912, Mexican revolutionaries drove all foreigners out of Mexico, including Ammon's familie

1 CONT TH0MAS SKINNER (Thomas), was born in Subdeanerie Parish, Chichester, England, July 25, 1645. He married Mary, daughter of Richard and Mary Pratt of Charlestown. She was born Sept. 7 or 30, 1643, and died in Colchester, Conn., March 26, 1704. Her fa
1 CONC ther, Richard Pratt, was, it is said, the youngest of nine children of John Pratt of Malden, county Essex, England, and was baptized there, June 29, 1615. He died in 1691. About the beginning of the eighteenth century, Deacon Thomas Skinner remove
1 CONC d with his wife, sons Richard, Benjamin, Ebenezer, Nathaniel, and daughter Abigail to Colchester, Conn., where he was an original proprietor and his name and that of his son Ebenezer appear frequently in the records, holding various town offices. O
1 CONC n Jauuary 21,1702, he and his son Benjamin and others were granted a lot of land, "the littel Round Medow," etc., and in May of the same year there was granted to Thomas Skinner a house lot one hundred and sixty rods in length and twenty-one rods i
1 CONC n breadth, and in addition sixty acres of land. In the trustees' deed to the original proprietors, dated April 28, 1713, appear the names of Thomas Skinner and his sons Richard, Benjamin and Ebenezer. On March 29, 1709, he deeded land "to my son Na
1 CONC thaniel Skinner," and on July 19, 1715, "to my son Ebenezer Skinner." I have been unable to find the record of his death, but in May, 1722, the Assemblv released Deacon Thomas Skinner and Joseph Gellett from "all taxes that are due to the publick t
1 CONC reasury upon account of an assessment set upon their heads by the listers of Colchester in the year 1720."  After that I see his name no more. In a diary, kept by his son Thomas, and now in possession of a descendant, is recorded "The birth of al
1 CONC l my father's children except Abigail." Also: "Mother Skinner died March 26, 1704." Thomas's record of his mother's death agrees with the date in the Colchester town records of the death of "Mary the wife of  Dea. Thomas Skiner."

1 CONT I exchange data with people who have a interlocking marriage
1 CONT into any surnames that interlocks into any of the branches
1 CONT of my families.I started when I was 10 years old now 68years.
1 CONT 
1 CONT I am sharing my data in the interest of collaborative research.
1 CONT I do this to help people to find there lineages and to fill
1 CONT the pedigree charts.
1 CONT 
1 CONT I have not personally researched all families listed; dates
1 CONT and information are subject to verification. Not responsible
1 CONT for typographical errors misplaced citations.  Missing
1 CONT sources/references are because of my learning curve,not my
1 CONT intention.  You are encouraged to seek further documention
1 CONT for your own confirmation.Further I have no control what
1 CONT other people include about their families in any of the
1 CONT data that they exchange.
1 CONT 
1 CONT If there are no dates about the living, then the computers
1 CONT can not determine if the person is alive or deceased.
1 CONT The sites set the living anywhere from 75 to 100 years
1 CONT depending on the  laws of the countries that they are in.
1 CONT 
1 CONT When I exchange with lineages the living are sometime shown
1 CONT depending on who you are exchanging with, but my
1 CONT request  is that,if you update any of  my data to the
1 CONT internet, you also set the do not show the living,before
1 CONT you update to the internet.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Also place in the source your contact email
1 CONT address,and the lineage, so people can contact you
1 CONT reqarding your update.
1 CONT 
1 CONT I have no claim to owning the data, except that which is
1 CONT my immediate lineage, and even that is worked on by many
1 CONT members of my family lineages.  It is only as good as what
1 CONT people put into it,that exchange with me.  So look
1 CONT in the notes of the genealogy for origin, if they put it
1 CONT there,or the source.
1 CONT 
1 CONT If you are going to correct,update or put new branches on the
1 CONT lineage your are inquirying about,please do not add from what
1 CONT I have sent you,(This just duplicates how many more people
1 CONT I have to find in the duplicates and merge them,edit your
1 CONT notes to ensure that there is nothing there that you do not
1 CONT want published.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Also do not submit information on copyrights that invades the
1 CONT privacy of others especially for a relative that has not given
1 CONT you permission to publish same.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Remember nothing is carved in stone except time.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The best way for me to describe the relationship, is for
1 CONT example if you have 6,000 people in your data base
1 CONT that are connected via interlocking marriages, and
1 CONT you find that you have a marriage that is interlocked into
1 CONT one of my people in my data base, then they are related
1 CONT via interlocking marriages, does not matter how distant.
1 CONT The difference here is that the interlocking into my data
1 CONT base would link to over 631,749 people via interlocking
1 CONT marriages.
1 CONT 
1 CONT My hobby is working on interlocking marriages,to any
1 CONT family surname that is in my data,and I exchange with
1 CONT people to find them,and to assist them in  finding lineage
1 CONT that link into their families.

1 CONT Preserved Strong moved from Northampton, MA to Lebanon, CT in
1 CONT 1714; six years later he moved to Coventry, CT where he served
1 CONT as selectman in the 1730s.  Tradition says that the name
1 CONT Preserved comes from the fact he was born in a raging snowstorm
1 CONT and survived ( Strong descendants; 2;986).
1 CONT 
1 CONT I exchange data with people who have a interlocking marriage
1 CONT into any surnames that interlocks into any of the branches
1 CONT of my families.I started when I was 10 years old now 68years.
1 CONT 
1 CONT I am sharing my data in the interest of collaborative research.
1 CONT I do this to help people to find there lineages and to fill
1 CONT the pedigree charts.
1 CONT 
1 CONT I have not personally researched all families listed; dates
1 CONT and information are subject to verification. Not responsible
1 CONT for typographical errors misplaced citations.  Missing
1 CONT sources/references are because of my learning curve,not my
1 CONT intention.  You are encouraged to seek further documention
1 CONT for your own confirmation.Further I have no control what
1 CONT other people include about their families in any of the
1 CONT data that they exchange.
1 CONT 
1 CONT If there are no dates about the living, then the computers
1 CONT can not determine if the person is alive or deceased.
1 CONT The sites set the living anywhere from 75 to 100 years
1 CONT depending on the  laws of the countries that they are in.
1 CONT 
1 CONT When I exchange with lineages the living are sometime shown
1 CONT depending on who you are exchanging with, but my
1 CONT request  is that,if you update any of  my data to the
1 CONT internet, you also set the do not show the living,before
1 CONT you update to the internet.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Also place in the source your contact email
1 CONT address,and the lineage, so people can contact you
1 CONT reqarding your update.
1 CONT 
1 CONT I have no claim to owning the data, except that which is
1 CONT my immediate lineage, and even that is worked on by many
1 CONT members of my family lineages.  It is only as good as what
1 CONT people put into it,that exchange with me.  So look
1 CONT in the notes of the genealogy for origin, if they put it
1 CONT there,or the source.
1 CONT 
1 CONT If you are going to correct,update or put new branches on the
1 CONT lineage your are inquirying about,please do not add from what
1 CONT I have sent you,(This just duplicates how many more people
1 CONT I have to find in the duplicates and merge them,edit your
1 CONT notes to ensure that there is nothing there that you do not
1 CONT want published.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Also do not submit information on copyrights that invades the
1 CONT privacy of others especially for a relative that has not given
1 CONT you permission to publish same.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Remember nothing is carved in stone except time.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The best way for me to describe the relationship, is for
1 CONT example if you have 6,000 people in your data base
1 CONT that are connected via interlocking marriages, and
1 CONT you find that you have a marriage that is interlocked into
1 CONT one of my people in my data base, then they are related
1 CONT via interlocking marriages, does not matter how distant.
1 CONT The difference here is that the interlocking into my data
1 CONT base would link to over 631,749 people via interlocking
1 CONT marriages.
1 CONT 
1 CONT My hobby is working on interlocking marriages,to any
1 CONT family surname that is in my data,and I exchange with
1 CONT people to find them,and to assist them in  finding lineage
1 CONT that link into their families.

1 CONT the pedigree charts.
1 CONT 
1 CONT I have not personally researched all families listed; dates
1 CONT and information are subject to verification. Not responsible
1 CONT for typographical errors misplaced citations.  Missing
1 CONT sources/references are because of my learning curve,not my
1 CONT intention.  You are encouraged to seek further documention
1 CONT for your own confirmation.Further I have no control what
1 CONT other people include about their families in any of the
1 CONT data that they exchange.
1 CONT 
1 CONT If there are no dates about the living, then the computers
1 CONT can not determine if the person is alive or deceased.
1 CONT The sites set the living anywhere from 75 to 100 years
1 CONT depending on the  laws of the countries that they are in.
1 CONT 
1 CONT When I exchange with lineages the living are sometime shown
1 CONT depending on who you are exchanging with, but my
1 CONT request  is that,if you update any of  my data to the
1 CONT internet, you also set the do not show the living,before
1 CONT you update to the internet.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Also place in the source your contact email
1 CONT address,and the lineage, so people can contact you
1 CONT reqarding your update.
1 CONT 
1 CONT I have no claim to owning the data, except that which is
1 CONT my immediate lineage, and even that is worked on by many
1 CONT members of my family lineages.  It is only as good as what
1 CONT people put into it,that exchange with me.  So look
1 CONT in the notes of the genealogy for origin, if they put it
1 CONT there,or the source.
1 CONT 
1 CONT If you are going to correct,update or put new branches on the
1 CONT lineage your are inquirying about,please do not add from what
1 CONT I have sent you,(This just duplicates how many more people
1 CONT I have to find in the duplicates and merge them,edit your
1 CONT notes to ensure that there is nothing there that you do not
1 CONT want published.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Also do not submit information on copyrights that invades the
1 CONT privacy of others especially for a relative that has not given
1 CONT you permission to publish same.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Remember nothing is carved in stone except time.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The best way for me to describe the relationship, is for
1 CONT example if you have 6,000 people in your data base
1 CONT that are connected via interlocking marriages, and
1 CONT you find that you have a marriage that is interlocked into
1 CONT one of my people in my data base, then they are related
1 CONT via interlocking marriages, does not matter how distant.
1 CONT The difference here is that the interlocking into my data
1 CONT base would link to over 631,749 people via interlocking
1 CONT marriages.
1 CONT 
1 CONT My hobby is working on interlocking marriages,to any
1 CONT family surname that is in my data,and I exchange with
1 CONT people to find them,and to assist them in  finding lineage
1 CONT that link into their families.

1 CONT I exchange data with people who have a interlocking marriage
1 CONT into any surnames that interlocks into any of the branches
1 CONT of my families.I started when I was 10 years old now 68years.
1 CONT 
1 CONT I am sharing my data in the interest of collaborative research.
1 CONT I do this to help people to find there lineages and to fill
1 CONT the pedigree charts.
1 CONT 
1 CONT I have not personally researched all families listed; dates
1 CONT and information are subject to verification. Not responsible
1 CONT for typographical errors misplaced citations.  Missing
1 CONT sources/references are because of my learning curve,not my
1 CONT intention.  You are encouraged to seek further documention
1 CONT for your own confirmation.Further I have no control what
1 CONT other people include about their families in any of the
1 CONT data that they exchange.
1 CONT 
1 CONT If there are no dates about the living, then the computers
1 CONT can not determine if the person is alive or deceased.
1 CONT The sites set the living anywhere from 75 to 100 years
1 CONT depending on the  laws of the countries that they are in.
1 CONT 
1 CONT When I exchange with lineages the living are sometime shown
1 CONT depending on who you are exchanging with, but my
1 CONT request  is that,if you update any of  my data to the
1 CONT internet, you also set the do not show the living,before
1 CONT you update to the internet.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Also place in the source your contact email
1 CONT address,and the lineage, so people can contact you
1 CONT reqarding your update.
1 CONT 
1 CONT I have no claim to owning the data, except that which is
1 CONT my immediate lineage, and even that is worked on by many
1 CONT members of my family lineages.  It is only as good as what
1 CONT people put into it,that exchange with me.  So look
1 CONT in the notes of the genealogy for origin, if they put it
1 CONT there,or the source.
1 CONT 
1 CONT If you are going to correct,update or put new branches on the
1 CONT lineage your are inquirying about,please do not add from what
1 CONT I have sent you,(This just duplicates how many more people
1 CONT I have to find in the duplicates and merge them,edit your
1 CONT notes to ensure that there is nothing there that you do not
1 CONT want published.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Also do not submit information on copyrights that invades the
1 CONT privacy of others especially for a relative that has not given
1 CONT you permission to publish same.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Remember nothing is carved in stone except time.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The best way for me to describe the relationship, is for
1 CONT example if you have 6,000 people in your data base
1 CONT that are connected via interlocking marriages, and
1 CONT you find that you have a marriage that is interlocked into
1 CONT one of my people in my data base, then they are related
1 CONT via interlocking marriages, does not matter how distant.
1 CONT The difference here is that the interlocking into my data
1 CONT base would link to over 631,749 people via interlocking
1 CONT marriages.
1 CONT 
1 CONT My hobby is working on interlocking marriages,to any
1 CONT family surname that is in my data,and I exchange with
1 CONT people to find them,and to assist them in  finding lineage
1 CONT that link into their families.

1 CONT I exchange data with people who have a interlocking marriage
1 CONT into any surnames that interlocks into any of the branches
1 CONT of my families.I started when I was 10 years old now 68years.
1 CONT 
1 CONT I am sharing my data in the interest of collaborative research.
1 CONT I do this to help people to find there lineages and to fill
1 CONT the pedigree charts.
1 CONT 
1 CONT I have not personally researched all families listed; dates
1 CONT and information are subject to verification. Not responsible
1 CONT for typographical errors misplaced citations.  Missing
1 CONT sources/references are because of my learning curve,not my
1 CONT intention.  You are encouraged to seek further documention
1 CONT for your own confirmation.Further I have no control what
1 CONT other people include about their families in any of the
1 CONT data that they exchange.
1 CONT 
1 CONT If there are no dates about the living, then the computers
1 CONT can not determine if the person is alive or deceased.
1 CONT The sites set the living anywhere from 75 to 100 years
1 CONT depending on the  laws of the countries that they are in.
1 CONT 
1 CONT When I exchange with lineages the living are sometime shown
1 CONT depending on who you are exchanging with, but my
1 CONT request  is that,if you update any of  my data to the
1 CONT internet, you also set the do not show the living,before
1 CONT you update to the internet.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Also place in the source your contact email
1 CONT address,and the lineage, so people can contact you
1 CONT reqarding your update.
1 CONT 
1 CONT I have no claim to owning the data, except that which is
1 CONT my immediate lineage, and even that is worked on by many
1 CONT members of my family lineages.  It is only as good as what
1 CONT people put into it,that exchange with me.  So look
1 CONT in the notes of the genealogy for origin, if they put it
1 CONT there,or the source.
1 CONT 
1 CONT If you are going to correct,update or put new branches on the
1 CONT lineage your are inquirying about,please do not add from what
1 CONT I have sent you,(This just duplicates how many more people
1 CONT I have to find in the duplicates and merge them,edit your
1 CONT notes to ensure that there is nothing there that you do not
1 CONT want published.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Also do not submit information on copyrights that invades the
1 CONT privacy of others especially for a relative that has not given
1 CONT you permission to publish same.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Remember nothing is carved in stone except time.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The best way for me to describe the relationship, is for
1 CONT example if you have 6,000 people in your data base
1 CONT that are connected via interlocking marriages, and
1 CONT you find that you have a marriage that is interlocked into
1 CONT one of my people in my data base, then they are related
1 CONT via interlocking marriages, does not matter how distant.
1 CONT The difference here is that the interlocking into my data
1 CONT base would link to over 631,749 people via interlocking
1 CONT marriages.
1 CONT 
1 CONT My hobby is working on interlocking marriages,to any
1 CONT family surname that is in my data,and I exchange with
1 CONT people to find them,and to assist them in  finding lineage
1 CONT that link into their families.

1 CONC s another more favorite with the people, he to avoid bloodshed fled to this country with a young man by the name of Caverley then about 18 years of age, his nephew and the king's foot page. Having access to the royal treasury he loaded a ship wit

1 CONT 
1 CONT Polly's grandmother Jemima Skinner had three known brothers: Joseph, Amos, and Jedediah.  Unless there was another brother whose name is not known, Amos must be the one to whom this story refers, because Joseph and Jedediah both died when they wer

1 CONT  Simon and Deborah moved to Lebanon, CT in 1713.  A branch of this family eventually moved to Nova Scotia, from whom the distinguished astronomer Simon Newcomb descended. Simon's occupation, from BMN 1923, is listed as farmer and landowner. It is p

1 CONC f Martha's Vineyard, Dukes Co., Mass., where they remained until the autumn of 17I3; when he established the family at Lebanon, New London Co., Conn: Mr. Newcomb's name first appears on record as owning land at Sagadahock, Me., in I686: Under dat
1 CONC e ot 26 July 1693, he bought land; recorded Salem, Me., 28 Aug. 1693, "near the mouth of Sagadahock, River. On the I3th of Mar. 1693-4, he bought of Thomas Wallen; for £10 Meadow at Manado, by the Beach, one share called the Purchase, I0 acres upl
1 CONC and a half- mile from the harbor, adjoining Mill Path, and half of Common, on Martha's Vineyard. He was named in the will of Wm. Vinson of Edgartown, 10 May I690, as one to see that the provisions of the will were faithfully executed. He owned seve

1 CONC ract of land calle d Job's Neck, alias Sopotaming, situated four miles .southwest from the village of Edgartown, and bounded on the south and west by what is now known as Job's Neck Pond, and two years later purchased two shares, of adjoining land

1 CONC r next to Pokitipasses Neck." Upon this large farm-the result of purchases and grants as above-he lived for many years. His house must have been in full view of the biue Atlantic. In I710-I I Mr. Newcomb bought of Susannah,widow of Wm. Vinson, fo
1 CONC r £40, shares in meadow in Sanchakantachet Neck and Commonage-later the celebrated camp-meeting ground near Holmes Hole, in the town of Tisbury. In I7I6 he bought of his stepmother, Anna Newcomb, for £20, land in Edgartown, bounded easterly by We
1 CONC entucket, northerly by Mill Path to the utmost extent of town, southerly by ponds and cove. He also owned lands at Swan Neck Point, and at other places, all on Martha's Vineyard. His lands on Chappaquiddick he sold to various persons; apart of hi
1 CONC s home farm at Job's Neck he sold, 6 Mar. 1711-12, to Samuel Smith. June I, I7I3, for £27, he sold to his brother, Joseph' Newcomb, a half-share meadow at Felixes Neck, and 6 acres at Manado; also, 10 June I7I4, for £7 12s: 6d., half of the 15t

1 CONT 
1 CONT I am sharing my data in the interest of collaborative research.
1 CONT I do this to help people to find there lineages and to fill

1 CONT 
1 CONT I have not personally researched all families listed; dates
1 CONT and information are subject to verification. Not responsible
1 CONT for typographical errors misplaced citations.  Missing

1 CONT 
1 CONT If there are no dates about the living, then the computers
1 CONT can not determine if the person is alive or deceased.
1 CONT The sites set the living anywhere from 75 to 100 years
1 CONT depending on the  laws of the countries that they are in.
1 CONT 
1 CONT When I exchange with lineages the living are sometime shown
1 CONT depending on who you are exchanging with, but my
1 CONT request  is that,if you update any of  my data to the
1 CONT internet, you also set the do not show the living,before
1 CONT you update to the internet.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Also place in the source your contact email

1 CONT in the notes of the genealogy for origin, if they put it
1 CONT there,or the source.
1 CONT 
1 CONT If you are going to correct,update or put new branches on the
1 CONT lineage your are inquirying about,please do not add from what
1 CONT I have sent you,(This just duplicates how many more people

1 CONT 
1 CONT Also do not submit information on copyrights that invades the

1 CONT you permission to publish same.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Remember nothing is carved in stone except time.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The best way for me to describe the relationship, is for
1 CONT example if you have 6,000 people in your data base
1 CONT that are connected via interlocking marriages, and
1 CONT you find that you have a marriage that is interlocked into
1 CONT one of my people in my data base, then they are related
1 CONT via interlocking marriages, does not matter how distant.

1 CONT 
1 CONT Ammon was born to Nathan Cram Tenney and Olive Strong.
1 CONT 
1 CONT His mother, and then his father, joined the Mormon church in the early 1840s, when Ammon was a very young child.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The family had been living in Nauvoo, Illinois, but then moved to Lee County, Iowa, across the Mississippi river from Nauvoo, about 1844.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Ammon's family left with the main body of Mormons when they left Nauvoo to go to Winter Quarters (Florence), Nebraska in 1846. In 1848, the family left Winter Quarters and traveled by wagon train to Utah, where they settled in Cottonwood, Grand Cou
1 CONC nty, Utah. The family later lived in San Bernardino, California, southern Utah, and Arizona. 
1 CONT 
1 CONT Ammon learned to speak Spanish in California and used that skill to act as a Mormon missionary and scout in the Southwest United States. He spent most of his life as a Mormon missionary in Arizona, New Mexico, and Mexico.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Ammon was a polygamist; by 1872 he had two wives. In 1884, he was arrested and convicted of polygamy; he was sentenced to 3 1/2 years in the Detroit House of Corrections. He had served over two years of his sentence when he was pardoned by Presiden
1 CONC t Cleveland.
1 CONT 
1 CONT In 1890, Ammon wanted to take a third polygamous wife; to do so he had to go to Mexico, because the Mormon church had promised the federal government they would not continue practicing polygamy, although they did to some extent. Polygamy was also i
1 CONC llegal in Mexico, but the Mexican government did not spend much time proscecuting people who practiced it.
1 CONT 
1 CONT After bringing all his wives to Mexico, in 1890, his first wife, Anna, separated from him.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Anna and her children continued to live in Colonia Diaz, while Ammon and his other two wives moved to Colonia Dublan and other places in Mexico. In 1912, Mexican revolutionaries drove all foreigners out of Mexico, including Ammon's families.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Ammon married: 
1 CONT 
1 CONT (1) Anna Sariah Eagar November 9, 1867 in Salt Lake City, Utah. They had ten children together. She separated from him.
1 CONT 
1 CONT (2) Eliza Ann Udall on December 12, 1872 in Salt Lake City, Utah. They had two children together. She separated from him.
1 CONT 
1 CONT (3) Hettie Millicent Adams on March 24, 1890 in Colonia Diaz, Chihuahua, Mexico. They had ten children together. She separated from him.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Ammon lived alone in El Paso, Texas and other locations in the South and Southwest, until he died in Thatcher, Arizona.

1 CONT Stephen remained at Hartford when his father removed to Killingworth, or returned there shortly afterwards, as he occupied his father's house.  "Steven Calsey" was proposed as "freeman" at the General Court, 11 Oct 1683, and was accepted in May 168
1 CONC 4.  In Oct 1698, the General Court granted to Stephen Kelsey, of Hartford, thirty shillings in cash, for damage done to a horse hired of him for public purposes.  In the Hartford Probate Records we find the following relating to him, --Vol. 1, p.72
1 CONC , Stephen Kelsey was one of the "proprietors" who received a share in the division of land previously held in common on the east side of the run, from Windsor to Glastonbury Bounds.  (This was probably in the right of his father, William, he havin
1 CONC g taken over his father's property in Hartford.)  Vol. 1, p. 351, John Pratt bequeathed land bounded on the south by the land of Steven Kellsy in will dated 9 Apr 1687; and in same volume, p. 558, Stephen Kelsey is directed by the Court to assist i
1 CONC n regard to estate of Jacob Goff, of Wethersfield, 12 Apr 1699, and signed report on same, to Probate Court, 16 Feb 1707/8; appointed one of the distributors of the estate, 2 Feb 1707/8, and signed another report on the same, 11 Mar 1707/8.  In th
1 CONC e Hartford Deeds we find records, --Distribution Book, p. 579, deed from William Kelsey of his homestead in Hartford to his son Stephen; Liber 1, p. 169, is a deed of "Lands in Hartford, Belonging to John Merrils, Junr. and unto Abraham Merrils, an
1 CONC d their Hiers for Ever.  One piece of land (among others) wch Abra Merrils purchased of Stephen Kelsy in the West Division in Hartford, near or upon Hower (?) Mile Hill, 24 acres....as may appear by his Deed Dated 28 Jun 1698."  Acknowledged 30 Jun
1 CONC , and recorded 11 Jun 1698.  As mentioned above, William Kelsey deeded his Hartford home to his son, Stephen, in 1671, and in the following year he, Stephen, married Hannah Ingersoll, daughter of John Ingersoll, of Hartford, later Westfield, MA.  H
1 CONC inman says that she was the daughter of John Higginson of Wethersfield, but this mistake arises from the fact that the name of Ingersoll was often written as Hingersoll, and even Hingerson in the early records; Savage also makes an error in namin
1 CONC g her mother as Hannah Lord, her mother having been Dorothy Lord, daughter of Thomas and Dorothy Lord.   The births of the children of Stephen and Hannah are all recorded in Hartford with the exception of the first three daughters, Dorothy, Mary an
1 CONC d Hannah; also the death record of Stephen, but there is no record of the death of his wife, who survived him at least as late as the year 1714, for we have a deed of William, dated 3 Dec 1714, in which he makes reservation in favor of his mother
1 CONC , Hannah, widow of Stephen, and the deed of James and Hannah Kibbe to their brother, William, dated 5 Dec 1714, is witnesses by their mother, Hannah Kelsey.  Perhaps she lived until much later, as late as the early part of 1732/3, for we find the i
1 CONC nventory of a Hannah Kelsey, amounting to (in British currency) 55-12-03, taken by Joseph Talcott, Jr., and Jonathan Olcott on 19 Mar of that year.  Administration was granted to Obadiah Spencer of Hartford.  Stephen died intestate, 30 Nov 1710, hi
1 CONC s widow, Hannah Kelsey and his son William being appointed administrators.  The inventory was taken on 20 Dec 1710 by Aaron Cook, Nathaniell Goodwin and Ebenezer Gilbert, the value being given as (in British currency) 358-06-00.  (A printed recor

1 CONT I exchange data with people who have a interlocking marriage
1 CONT into any surnames that interlocks into any of the branches
1 CONT of my families.I started when I was 10 years old now 68years.
1 CONT 
1 CONT I am sharing my data in the interest of collaborative research.
1 CONT I do this to help people to find there lineages and to fill
1 CONT the pedigree charts.
1 CONT 
1 CONT I have not personally researched all families listed; dates
1 CONT and information are subject to verification. Not responsible
1 CONT for typographical errors misplaced citations.  Missing
1 CONT sources/references are because of my learning curve,not my
1 CONT intention.  You are encouraged to seek further documention
1 CONT for your own confirmation.Further I have no control what
1 CONT other people include about their families in any of the
1 CONT data that they exchange.
1 CONT 
1 CONT If there are no dates about the living, then the computers
1 CONT can not determine if the person is alive or deceased.
1 CONT The sites set the living anywhere from 75 to 100 years
1 CONT depending on the  laws of the countries that they are in.
1 CONT 
1 CONT When I exchange with lineages the living are sometime shown
1 CONT depending on who you are exchanging with, but my
1 CONT request  is that,if you update any of  my data to the
1 CONT internet, you also set the do not show the living,before
1 CONT you update to the internet.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Also place in the source your contact email
1 CONT address,and the lineage, so people can contact you
1 CONT reqarding your update.
1 CONT 
1 CONT I have no claim to owning the data, except that which is
1 CONT my immediate lineage, and even that is worked on by many
1 CONT members of my family lineages.  It is only as good as what
1 CONT people put into it,that exchange with me.  So look
1 CONT in the notes of the genealogy for origin, if they put it
1 CONT there,or the source.
1 CONT 
1 CONT If you are going to correct,update or put new branches on the
1 CONT lineage your are inquirying about,please do not add from what
1 CONT I have sent you,(This just duplicates how many more people
1 CONT I have to find in the duplicates and merge them,edit your
1 CONT notes to ensure that there is nothing there that you do not
1 CONT want published.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Also do not submit information on copyrights that invades the
1 CONT privacy of others especially for a relative that has not given
1 CONT you permission to publish same.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Remember nothing is carved in stone except time.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The best way for me to describe the relationship, is for
1 CONT example if you have 6,000 people in your data base
1 CONT that are connected via interlocking marriages, and
1 CONT you find that you have a marriage that is interlocked into
1 CONT one of my people in my data base, then they are related
1 CONT via interlocking marriages, does not matter how distant.
1 CONT The difference here is that the interlocking into my data
1 CONT base would link to over 631,749 people via interlocking
1 CONT marriages.
1 CONT 
1 CONT My hobby is working on interlocking marriages,to any
1 CONT family surname that is in my data,and I exchange with
1 CONT people to find them,and to assist them in  finding lineage
1 CONT that link into their families.

1 CONT - [p. 179]
1 CONT Upon his return to Salt Lake City on April 16,1870, Brigham Young sent a
1 CONT group of fifty-two people led by Levi Stewart, to re-settle the Kanab
1 CONT country. They went down through the Dixie [p.180] settlements and
1 CONT reached Pipe Springs on June 1. They remained there and at Moccasin
1 CONT Springs several days while exploring the region.80 On the 14th they moved
1 CONT over to Kanab Creek and joined Jacob Hamblin at the old fort, now too small
1 CONT to house so many.
1 CONT Brigham Young manifested much interest in the success of the colony. He
1 CONT promised Stewart that he would visit him in the fall and asked him to kind a
1 CONT more direct route to Kanab from the north that would obviate the long
1 CONT roundabout approach through the Dixie settlements and the Arizona strip.
1 CONT Stewart sent out two expeditions, the second of which found a road from
1 CONT the head of the Sevier River through Upper Kanab and Johnson Wash.
1 CONT [p. 190]
1 CONT In 1870, Brigham Young sent a portable steam sawmill to Kanab and Levi
1 CONT Stewart installed it near Scutumpah and the next year moved it to Big
1 CONT Springs on the Kaibab. Many years later, it was moved farther south to
1 CONT Castle or Rigg Springs.
1 CONT In 1872, Major Powell's party centered its work around the Kaibab. Part of
1 CONT the time, this party camped near the Levi Stewart ranch and sawmill.91 At
1 CONT that time Eight-Mile Spring, Jacob's Well (Pool or Lake), Oak Spring, Pine
1 CONT Spring, and Stewart's ranch were all being used as grazing headquarters.

1 CONT Bishop Levi Stewart was far and away the wealthiest man in Kanab, while in
1 CONT Mount Carmel Henry B. M. Jolley enjoyed a similar status. Stewart's holding
1 CONT was largely in cattle; Jolley's was more diversified, and in addition he was
1 CONT surrounded by a host of well-to-do relatives.
1 CONT Livestock appraisals were listed as of June 1, 1874. Bishop Levi Stewart
1 CONT led the list with six pages devoted to the description of his cattle.
1 CONT His holding of 160 head was valued at $3,569.00. His closest [p.152] rival
1 CONT was Taylor Crosby whose 76 head of horses and cattle and other property
1 CONT were valued at $1,801.75.

1 CONT --
1 CONT Levi Stewart, a casualty of a social experiment and another man's
1 CONT ambition, found his years at Kanab both tragic and frustrating. Called from
1 CONT a comfortable home in Big Cottonwood in the spring of 1870, he had
1 CONT cheerfully gone south and arrived et Jacob Hamblin's Paiute farm in June.
1 CONT On September 10 Brigham Young had selected the Kanab townsite and
1 CONT ordained Stewart the settlement's first bishop. On December 14 a
1 CONT disastrous fire in Kanab's log fort claimed Stewart's wife Margery and five
1 CONT of his children. Three years of hardship followed in which the bishop and his
1 CONT persevering flock had scratched a living from the harsh land. The running
1 CONT controversy with John R. Young had lasted a year and a half, followed by
1 CONT another year of secondary duty as vice-president to his successor. Then
1 CONT on dune 14, 1878, as Levi Stewart was traveling through Johnson Canyon
1 CONT enroute to Salt Lake City, he died of an apparent heart attack. President
1 CONT Nuttall dedicated his grave as the first in Kanab's new cemetery. Thus Levi
1 CONT Stewart was provided perpetuity from Kanab's turbulent past to the
1 CONT present.

1 CONT LEVI STEWART
1 CONT (1812-1878)
1 CONT If we could turn back the hands on the clock of time, back to the early years of 1800, and go visiting among the hills in Overton County, Tennessee, we would find there some of the descendants of Samuel and Lydia Stewart, who had moved from Stokes
1 CONC , or Forsyth County, North Carolina, to make new homes. It was here, about 1807, our progenitor, William Stewart, met and married Elizabeth Van Hooser (Hoosen), daughter of Abraham Van Hooser (Hoosen) and Mary Williams (Wilhelm). They were the pare
1 CONC nts of five sons, Squire, Riley, Levi, William Jackson, and Urban Van. These children were all born in Overton County, Tennessee, except Levi. It is with him, our direct ancestor, that this story has to do.
1 CONT Our grandfather, Levi Stewart, third son of William Stewart and Elizabeth Van Hooser, was born 28 April 1812 at West Edwardsville, Madison County, Illinois, where Elizabeth had gone to be with her mother for this event. After the birth of her baby
1 CONC , Elizabeth took her little family back to Tennessee. There they lived until Levi was about ten years old, when the family returned to Illinois. Levi grew to manhood here.
1 CONT Little is known of his young years, but photographs show him to be a man of large stature, over six feet tall, with dark hair and blue eyes. His fine character and pleasing personality won many friends wherever he went. He obtained a good educatio
1 CONC n for those times. He was successful in business and prospered. Church History references state that among claims filed against the State of Missouri for property destroyed when mobs drove the Saints from their homes, was a claim by Levi Stewart fo
1 CONC r $3, 950. This was a sizeable amount for those days.
1 CONT On the 12th of February 1833, Levi married Melinda Howard, daughter of John Howard and Jane Van Hooser (Hoosen) of Effingham, Madison County, Illinois. He took his bride to Vandalia, Fayette County, Illinois, to make a home. Here their first thre
1 CONC e children were born: Elizabeth Jane, 18 May 1834; Melinda Elvira, 1836 (who died in infancy); and Joseph Abram, 1 April 1837. About this time, two Mormon Elders came to Vandalia. Levi and Melinda heard them explain the principles of the Gospel. S
1 CONC o impressed were they that they began investigating. Subsequently, both became members of the Mormon Church. In April 1837, Levi was baptized by Jefferson Hunt in Caldwell County, Missouri, where he had gone to learn more of this new doctrine. Bein
1 CONC g completely converted, they later received their endowments and were married in the Nauvoo Temple, 13 January 1846.
1 CONT The Saints were now persecuted and driven from their homes because of sentiment against the Church. Levi was a devout believer, an active member, always willing to defend his leaders, and his Church against those who would destroy them. On one occa
1 CONC sion he was present at an election held 6 August 1838 when the people of Far West had called a meeting to appoint a. new postmaster, and also to discuss the possibility of establishing a weekly newspaper. Two weeks previous, Judge Morin had informe
1 CONC d Levi and John D. Lee that a mob had determined to prevent the Saints from voting. Hoping that things would become better, proper heed was not given to this warning, and the brethren had to fight desperately to maintain their rights as American ci
1 CONC tizens. The mob was finally driven off, and the Saints were commended by the Prophet for their victory against the enemy.
1 CONT As sentiment grew more bitter, and the people were driven from pillar to post, Levi had taken his family to Iowa. Here a fourth child, John Riley, was born 21 November 1840, near where the City of Des Moines now stands. Afterward, they went back t
1 CONC o Nauvoo, where two more children were born: Emma, 14 February 1843 who lived less than a year, and Louisa, 16 June 1845.
1 CONT At a conference held in Nauvoo, 10 April 1843, Levi and James Pace, father of John Pace of St. George, Utah, were called to labor as missionaries in Missouri. Records show he also served as a missionary in Illinois where John D. Lee was his compani
1 CONC on. The following letter copied from Journal History shows his earnest endeavors and success as a missionary.
1 CONT Under date of 13 April 1843, Elder Levi Stewart wrote from Nauvoo to the "Times and Seasons" -Editor, John Taylor:
1 CONT "I have traveled near six months since July last, most of which time I labored in the southern part of Missouri. There had been but few discourses delivered by any of the elders in these parts, therefore, prejudice was great. After hearing the Gosp
1 CONC el for themselves, the honest in heart began to discover the many falsehoods that have over-run the country, and began to investigate the doctrines of Christ. The result was, many believed, and I had more calls for preaching than I could attend to
1 CONC , and through the assistance of God, I was enabled to baptize 24 souls. I left many more believing, whom I hope will obey the Gospel. There is a great door open for preaching. My prayer to God is for the rolling forth of His Kingdom, Until the king
1 CONC doms of this world become the Kingdoms of our God."
1 CONT Your brother in the Everlasting Covenant, Levi Stewart.
1 CONT As opposition against the Church grew more, mobs were organized to seize Joseph Smith. Many times he was in the hands of his captors. An incident is mentioned of a rescue party sent out from Nauvoo to search for the Prophet. These men were instruct
1 CONC ed to go aboard a steamboat called the "Maid of Iowa," and be on the watch for an armed company who had chartered a steamer at St. Louis, and might have Joseph aboard. If they encountered such a boat, they were to rescue their leader at all hazards
1 CONC , and bring him back to Nauvoo. This party was accompanied by Apostle John Taylor. Levi and his brother, Urban Van, were also named with those aboard. The men worked all night cutting and loading wood for fuel. About 8:30 in the morning, the Pat

1 CONC hs of Levi Stewart showed him to be a man of large stature, over six feet tall, with blue eyes and dark hair. On Feb 12, 1833 he married Melinda Howard, daughter of John Howard and Jane Van Hooser. The Howard's were the first settlers on the Lookin
1 CONC g Glass Prairie in Madison Co. After Levi and Melinda's marriage they moved to Vandalia, Fayette Co., Illinois where their first three children were born.  In 1836, Mormon missionaries came into their community. Levi's interest was so stirred tha
1 CONC t he traveled to Far West, Missouri to meet the Prophet, Joseph Smith and to further investigate this religion. Upon baptism, Levi was determined to gather with the Church members so he sold his home in Vandalia, Illinois and moved to Far West, Mis
1 CONC souri arriving in June 1838. This was right during the middle of the Mormon expulsion from Missouri so in less than a year he headed back to Vandalia. Levi filed a redress petition of $3,800 for losses suffered when the Mormons were driven from Mis
1 CONC souri. He lost two farms in Davies Co., Missouri, a lot in Adam-ondi-ahman and Far West, cattle, horses and household furniture, none of which he received any remuneration.  The 1840 census of Lee Co., Iowa showed Levi and his brothers living acros
1 CONC s the Mississippi from Nauvoo, Illinois. By 1843 he had moved to Nauvoo, where upon he was called to serve several missions for the Mormon Church all without purse or script. On June 27, 1844, the Prophet Joseph Smith and his brother were murdere
1 CONC d in Carthage, Illinois. Thus began the eventual forced Mormon exodus from Nauvoo. Levi was sent out to scout routes and hunt deer for the pioneer camps. In April 1846 Levi was assigned to stay at Winter Quarters, Nebraska and run a commissary. Lev
1 CONC i was responsible fo r shuttling the mail between the pioneer camps and Nauvoo. As all the wagons had to go through Indian country, Levi was sent to St. Louis to get permission from the U.S. Govt. to stay on Indian lands.  On May 6, 1848, Levi an
1 CONC d Melinda's 8th child was born at Winter Quarters, Nebraska. In Sept 1848 they began their trek West to the valley of the Great Salt Lake, arriving four months later. For the next seventeen years Salt Lake City, Utah would be their home. They live
1 CONC d across the street from Immigration Square and often took in impoverished church members who had just arrived in SLC. He began a general merchandise store, was an officer in the Brigham Young Express Co. and vice president of the Big Cottonwood Co
1 CONC -Op store. On Dec 13, 1852, Levi married Margery Wilkerson. Tragedy befell Levi when his childhood sweetheart, Melinda, died November 24, 1853, three weeks after the birth of twins. On Dec 31, 1854, Levi married Margery's sister, Artemacy Willkerso
1 CONC n Casaday, whose husband had abandoned her and her child for the gold fields of California.  In 1853 the Utah Walker War began to subdue marauding Indians. The grasshopper plague in 1855 and the cricket plague in 1860 invaded Salt Lake. In 1858, Jo
1 CONC hnston's Army arrived to a silent and vacated SLC; thus church members averted the warfare and persecution of the Missouri and Illinois era. In 1865 at the request of Brigham Young, Levi sold his home in Salt Lake City and moved to Big Cottonwood C
1 CONC anyon to start a paper mill. In 1868 Brigham Young advised Levi to take a contract for grading a section of the Union Pacific Railroad down Echo Canyon. Ever obedient to the requests from his ecclesiastical leaders, Levi accepted the call from Brig
1 CONC ham Young, who had asked Levi to take his family and form a settlement in Kanab, Utah. At the age of 58, Levi again sold all his possessions, and moved to this remote and inaccessible area of southern Utah. Upon arrival in June of 1870, Levi was ma
1 CONC de work director to supervise the planti ng of fall crops. In September, Levi was made the first Bishop of Kanab, with the injunction to set up a sawmill and get out the lumber for building. In November, Levi's adopted son, William Casady Jr., died
1 CONC . His death was a prelude to the great tragedy that would befall them one month later. On the 14th of December 1870, a fire broke out in the fort and claimed the lives of Levi's wife, Margery and five sons.  A drought and grasshoppers took 2/3rds o
1 CONC f the wheat harvest during the summer of 1871. The winter of 1871 brought a measle epidemic and in 1872 an epidemic of Epizootic, a skin infestation, entered every home in Kanab. Ever fearful of Indian attacks, Levi, Margery and Artemacy had befrie
1 CONC nded the local Indians. Artemacy had been called to be a midwife and Levi had a great knowledge in the use of herbs. Even during these trying times, Levi started a cooperative store in his home and was name chairman of the board of ZCMI Kanab. He b

1 CONC ted. So Levi began again at the age of 64. Throughout Levi's life he had been a devout member of the Mormon religion. It had given him strength and faith to follow the directives of his Church leaders even though it would bring him impoverishment a
1 CONC nd death of his loved ones. Proceeded in death by wives Melinda and Margery, and 14 of his 29 children, Levi died June 14, 1878. The Indians accompanying Levi's body back to Kanab cried, "We have no more father". Thus ended the life of the Kanab co
